# hello-world
The time-honored tradition in computer programming

My name is Tiisetso Leshilo and I am really proud to be part of the Umuzi bootcamp. 
I have a mechanical engineering background and I am a newbie to software development.
I hope to learn more on this platform for my journey on becoming a software engineer / developer
